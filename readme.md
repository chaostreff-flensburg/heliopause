## Editor

An Editor for easy editing is provided on `/editor`.

## Api

### `GET '/'`

Get space api data.

---

### `POST '/'`

Post new api data. Returns the new api state on success. An authentication token is needed.

```json
{
  "api": {
    "space": "Chaostreff Flensburg"
    //...
  },
  "token": "your-api-token"
}
```

---

### `POST '/token'`

Create a new authentication token. Returns the new token on success. An authentication token is needed.

```json

  "token": "your-api-token"
}
```

A token can also be created with the `TOKEN` env-variable on startup.

```bash
$ TOKEN=your-token npm start
```

---

## Deployment

### As a node.js Project

Clone the repo and follow the build instructions under [Build Setup](<#Build\ Setup>).  
A node.js version of `10.4` or higher is needed. Older versions may work, but are not tested.

#### Data Migration

Older databases can be migrated by simply copying the `*.db` files from the `./data` directory.

## Development

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

When started with `npm run dev` an authentication token `dev` is created.

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code. Prettier should be run before creating a pull request. You can run it with the default settings from your editor. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://prettier.io).
